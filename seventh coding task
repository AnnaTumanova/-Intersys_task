Write a function in JS fixage that receives an array of integers. The integers represent ages between 0 and 100. 
The function is required to join all the integers that are between 18 and 60 into a string separated with a comma and returns it. 
If there is no integer between 18 and 60, then the function returns "NA"

var list = [2,23,4,5];
var pol=[];
for (var i in list)
{
  if (var i = 18; i <= 60; i++)
  {pol.push(i);}
    
}
else { 
  alert("NA");
  }
