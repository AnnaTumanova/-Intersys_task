Write a function in JS optionalPow that will receive two numeric arguments. 
The function is required to create some confirmation logic, where if the user agrees with the question (presses OK), 
then the function is required to compute the result of raising the first argument to the power determined by the second argument. 
If the user does not agree with the question (presses Cancel), then it should compute the power of the second argument raised to 
the first one. In both cases, the function must return the computed value.

function optionalPow(a, b) {
	var result = 1;
	if(a == b)
		b = 2;
	for(var i=1; i<=b; i++) {
		result = result * a;
                console.log("ok");
	}
	return result;
       else { 
               console.log("Cancel");
    }
}

console.log(optionalPow(2,4));
