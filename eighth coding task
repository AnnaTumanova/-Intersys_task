Write a program that takes an integer N (N between 2 and 20 inclusive), and an array of N integers as input. 
Your program should output the most occurring digit that appears in the numbers of this array. 
If more than one digit satisfies this condition, output the bigger one.

using System; 
          
public class appeariece { 
      
    static int getOccurence(int n, int d) 
    { 
          
        // Creating var result  
        int result = 0; 
      
        // Count appearances in numbers  starting from d. 
        int itr = d; 
        while (itr <= n) 
        { 
              
            // When the last digit is equal to d 
            if (itr % 10 == d) 
                result++; 
      
            // When the first digit is equal to d then 
            if (itr != 0 && itr/10 == d) 
            { 
                  
                // increment result as well as number 
                result++; 
                itr++; 
            }           
        return result; 
    } 
      
    // Driver code 
    public static void Main()  
    { 
        int n = 2, d = 20; 
          
        Console.Write(getOccurence(n, d)); 
    } 
}
